Car website - Stream 2 Project

This is a website focused on car market in norway in the last ten years (2007-2017). 

User Experience
This website is intended for users  to gain information about the car market in norway and see the comparison and the  market share and tje quantity sold of each brand in different time during the ten year period.
By seeing the different charts they can see the comparison which brand is a best seller for a particular time period. 
From the Lms videos was used to build this charts. There were some specific UX designs that were taken into consideration when styling this site. The navbar was on the top off the desktop view to present a cleaner, more minimalistic approach to the design,and every page has a background photo.
For the home page I have used the parallax effect with images and some information about the car market in Norway.
For the the brand market i have used a chart. 
And for statitstics there are the dc and d3 charts. 
The navbar is responsive (colapsable)and stays on top with a log inside. 
Every page have got a different background image and all of them are responsive to a diferrent screen sizes.  
For two of the pages I have used opacty the text to be more readable.

Development Process 
Cloud 9 - Used to code the project
Uploading the csv file was done first, then the graphs with the styling added after. As the styling was progressing, and after it was mostly finished, there were some graphs issues  that needed to be made.

Manual Testing:
Manual testing was done for all of the links and buttons in the  in website. This was to ensure that everything was working properly. All links are verified to be working correctly via manual testing.Testing was done on multiple browsers, at different resolutions.

Functionality:
Needs to have a responsive design forusing on mobile first design. This has been accomplished using Bootstrap.

Features  
One more csv file was created for the filter because car bands were to many and know  they are devided by the county they are made and now the graphs are working with both of them.
The navbar is responsive and stays on top using a high index value.  
For one of the graphs(total sales by mont for one year) i have added  domain for the x ordinal of the graph.Just the data in the chart to be more readable and understandable
